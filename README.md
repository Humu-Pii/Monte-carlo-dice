* What is a Monte Carlo Simulation?
A Monte Carlo simulation is a type of computational algorithm that estimates the probability of occurrence of an undeterminable event due to the involvement of random variables. The algorithm relies on repeated random sampling in an attempt to determine the probability. This means simulating an event with random inputs a large number of times to obtain the estimation.

* When learning how to build Monte Carlo simulations, itâ€™s best to start with a basic model to understand the fundamentals. The easiest and most common way to do that is with simple games, so we will make use of a dice game
